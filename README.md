# Twitter

A basic mock Twitter app using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: Vue

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

The mock Twitter app can dynamically add new tweets. Like and Retweet quantity can be increased dynamically. Top tweets can be toggled on and off using Top/Latest buttons. Total likes can also be viewed.

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.
